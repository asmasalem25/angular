<h2 id="angular7-overview">Angular7 Overview</h2>
<p>Angular  is a JavaScript  <strong>(actually a TypeScript based open-source full-stack web application)</strong>  framework which makes you able to create reactive  <strong>Single Page Applications</strong>  (SPAs). Angular 7 is completely based on components. It consists of several components which forms a tree structure with parent and child components. Angular’s versions beyond 2+ are generally known as  <strong>Angular</strong>  only. The very first version Angular 1.0 is known as  <strong>AngularJS.</strong></p>
<p>“Angular is a complete rewrite of AngularJS by the same team that built AngularJS.”</p>
<h2 id="what-is-single-page-application-spa">What is Single Page Application (SPA)?</h2>
<p>A single page application is a web application or a website which provides users a very fluid, reactive and fast experience similar to a desktop application. It contains menu, buttons and blocks on a single page and when a user clicks on any of them; it dynamically rewrites the current page rather than loading entire new pages from a server. That’s the reason behind its reactive fast speed.</p>
<h2 id="why-angular7">Why Angular7?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Detailed documentation.</strong>  Angular boasts detailed documentation where developers can find all necessary information without asking their colleagues. As a result, developers can quickly come up with technical solutions and resolve emerging issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support by Google.</strong>  A lot of developers consider Google support another benefit of Angular, making the platform trustworthy. At ng-conf 2017, the developers of Angular confirmed that Google will support Angular on a long-term basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Great</strong> <strong>ecosystem of third-party components.</strong> The popularity of Angular has resulted in the appearance of thousands of additional tools and components that can be used in Angular apps. As a result, you can get additional functionality and productivity improvements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Component-based architecture.</strong><br>
In the second version, Angular shifted from an MVC to a component-based architecture. According to this architecture, an app is divided into independent logical and functional components. These components can easily be replaced and decoupled as well as reused in other parts of an app. In addition, component independence makes it easy to test a web app and ensure that every component works seamlessly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CLI</strong>. It is probably the most beloved feature for the majority of Angular developers. It automates the whole development process making app initialization, configuration, and development as easy as possible. The Angular CLI allows you to create a new Angular project, add features to it, and run unit and end-to-end tests with a few simple commands. It not only increases code quality but also greatly facilitates development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Angular Elements</strong>. Starting with Angular 6, developers can easily add custom elements to any web app built with React, JQuery, Vue, or any other environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Angular Material</strong>. This collection of Material Design elements optimized for Angular lets developers easily integrate UI components.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dependency injection</strong>. is quite an arguable advantage of Angular. In plain English, dependency injection refers to one object supplying the dependencies of another object. These dependencies define how various components are connected and show how changes in one part of the code affects other parts. On the one hand, using dependency injection makes code more readable and maintainable. It can greatly reduce the time spent testing and hence cut the costs of web development. Starting from version 2, Angular provides developers with a separate tree of dependency injectors that can be changed or replaced without reconfiguring all components. But on the other hand, dependency injection may be time-consuming and it may be hard to create dependencies for components.</p>
